Language should be based primarily on javascript

functions defined using function <function name>(<args>){}

primitive data types: int, bool, float, string.

statements delimited by ;

whitespace inconsequential except token separation

conditionals in the form of if(condition){result}

looping in the the form of for and while loops

variable scope local-only, values moved between functions in args and return values

implicit type-conversion

comments start with // and end with a \n

//Test function
function greet(person){
    print("Hello " + person);
}

greet("Jessie");
//end test function
